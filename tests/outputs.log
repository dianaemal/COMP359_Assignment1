Testing Merge Sort with Working Area:
Dividing: [3, 1, 2] into [3] and [1, 2]
Dividing: [1, 2] into [1] and [2]
Merging: [1] and [2] into [1, 2]
Auxiliary array state: [1, 2]
Merging: [3] and [1, 2] into [3, 1, 2]
Auxiliary array state: [1, 2, 3]
[1, 2, 3]

Testing Naive In-Place Merge Sort:
Dividing: [3, 1, 2] into [3] and [1, 2]
Dividing: [1, 2] into [1] and [2]
Merging: [1] and [2] into [1, 2]
Merging: [1, 3] and [2] into [1, 3, 2]
Merging: [2, 3] and [] into [2, 3]
[1, 2, 3]
